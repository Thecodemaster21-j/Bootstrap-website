For this project I didn't copy a website I tried to make a mock portfolio. With bootstrap I basically used for all the styles and I enjoyed the seemless experience of having premade styles
I used javascript to imagine adding a form validation stystem for the contact form and feedback function so people can add feedbacks about my websites
